# RedShelf Coding Exercise

At RedShelf, we parse accessibility metadata from ePub files. Using the following url as a reference http://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/metadata/evaluation.html, write a React app that parses all a11y: meta tag properties from HTML. 

A user of the app should be able to paste complete or partial HTML into a textarea, and the app should display the parsed properties in a table that updates in real-time. The table should be able to sort its contents in ascending and descending alphabetical order. 

You may want to use create-react-app to bootstrap the project. Please use Material UI to make it look nice, include a test or two (we use Jest, or consider mocha), and feel free to use any open-source dependency.  The code should be added to source control like github.
