# RedShelf Coding Exercise

At RedShelf, we parse accessibility metadata from ePub files. Using the following url as a reference http://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/metadata/evaluation.html, write a React app that parses all a11y: meta tag properties from HTML. 

A user of the app should be able to paste complete or partial HTML into a textarea, and the app should display the parsed properties in a table that updates in real-time. The table should be able to sort its contents in ascending and descending alphabetical order. 

You may want to use create-react-app to bootstrap the project. Please use Material UI to make it look nice, include a test or two (we use Jest, or consider mocha), and feel free to use any open-source dependency.  The code should be added to source control like github.

Here is an example of a snippet I should be able to paste into the app (taken from the daisy.org link above) for parsing:

 

## 1.  <metadata>

## 2.  <link rel="dcterms:conformsTo"

## 3.  href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/accessibility-20170105.html#wcag-aa"/>

## 4.  <meta property="a11y:certifiedBy">Dewey, Checkett and Howe</meta>

## 5.  <meta property="a11y:certifierCredential">Certifiably Accessible</meta>

## 6.  <link rel="a11y:certifierReport"

## 7.  href="https://example.com/reports/a11y/pub.html"/>

## 8.  â€¦

## 9.  </metadata>
